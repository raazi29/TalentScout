AI/ML Intern Assignment:   
Position: AI/ML Intern 
Deadline: 48 Hours from Assignment Receipt 
Submission: Provide all necessary submissions on Career page. 
 
I.  Assignment Overview 
You are tasked with developing an intelligent Hiring Assistant chatbot for "TalentScout," a 
fictional recruitment agency specializing in technology placements. The chatbot should assist in 
the initial screening of candidates by gathering essential information and posing relevant 
technical questions based on the candidate's declared tech stack. This project will allow you to 
demonstrate your understanding of LLM’s 
 
II. Purpose of Prompting  
The candidate will design prompts that guide the underlying language model to: 
1.  Gather Initial Candidate Information: Collect essential details such as name, contact 
information, years of experience, and desired positions. 
2.  Generate Technical Questions: Based on the candidate’s specified tech stack (e.g., 
programming languages, frameworks, tools), generate relevant technical questions to 
assess their proficiency. 
3.  Ensure Coherent and Context-Aware Interactions: Maintain the flow of conversation 
and context to provide a seamless user experience. 
 
 
 
III. Requirements 
Functionality 
●  User Interface: 
○  Develop a clean and intuitive UI using Streamlit or Gradio where candidates can 
interact with the chatbot. 
●  Chatbot Capabilities: 
○  Greeting: The chatbot should greet candidates upon initiation and provide a brief 
overview of its purpose. The chatbot should also exit whenever a 
conversation-ending keyword is encountered. 
○  Information Gathering: 
■  Collect essential candidate details such as: 
■  Full Name 
■  Email Address 
■  Phone Number 
■  Years of Experience 
■  Desired Position(s) 
■  Current Location 
■  Tech Stack 
○  Tech Stack Declaration: 
■  Prompt candidates to specify their tech stack, including programming 
languages, frameworks, databases, and tools they are proficient in. 
○  Technical Question Generation: 
■  Based on the declared tech stack, generate a set of 3-5 technical 
questions tailored to assess the candidate’s proficiency in each specified 
technology. 
■  Example: If a candidate lists Python and Django, generate questions 
related to Python programming and Django framework. 
○  Context Handling: 
■  Maintain the context of the conversation to handle follow-up questions 
and ensure a coherent flow. 
○  Fallback Mechanism: 
■  Provide meaningful responses when the chatbot does not understand the 
user input or when unexpected inputs are received. 
■  It should not deviate from the Purpose. 
○  End Conversation: 
■  Gracefully conclude the conversation, thanking the candidate and 
informing them about the next steps.

providing a live demo link. 
Prompt Engineering 
●  Design Effective Prompts: 
○  Craft prompts that accurately gather candidate information and generate relevant 
technical questions based on the declared tech stack. 
○  Ensure prompts are clear, concise, and guide the language model to produce 
desired outputs. 
●  Optimize for Diverse Tech Stacks: 
○  Handle a variety of technologies and frameworks, ensuring questions are 
relevant and appropriately challenging. 
●  Manage Sensitive Information: 
○  Implement techniques to handle and store sensitive candidate information 
securely and in compliance with data privacy best practices. 
Data Handling 
●  Simulated Data: 
○  Use simulated or anonymized data for any backend processes, such as storing 
candidate information and technical responses. 
●  Data Privacy: 
○  Ensure that all candidate data is handled in compliance with data privacy 
standards (e.g., GDPR). 
Documentation 
●  README File: 
○  Project Overview: Brief description of the Hiring Assistant chatbot and its 
capabilities. 
○  Installation Instructions: Detailed steps to set up and run the application locally.
